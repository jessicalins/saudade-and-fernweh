Olá, Hallo, Hey!

We are Jéssica and Adrian, and it has been a dream of ours for some time to take time off to travel the world, meet new people, discover new cultures, and have new experiences.
After some time preparing for it, it's finally happening: from April to October 2025, we'll begin our adventures around the world. 🗺️

We hope this blog will help us stay connected with everyone, even while we’re far away. Feel free to follow our adventures and send us messages! 😊
