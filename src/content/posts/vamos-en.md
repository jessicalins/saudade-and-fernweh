Everything's ready! After storing all our things in the basement of our building, we left with just two backpacks each. We prepared for this moment for over a year, and honestly, it still doesn’t feel real.

Now we’re in Würzburg (Adrian’s hometown), visiting his family and saying goodbye to Germany.

Our round-the-world trip starts in Asia: the first destination will be South Korea, in Seoul.

See you soon! ❤️
